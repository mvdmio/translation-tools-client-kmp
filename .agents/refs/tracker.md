# Tracker: GitHub Issues

Issues live as GitHub issues in this repo's GitHub repository. Use the `gh` CLI, which takes the repository from `git remote -v`. Pass multi-line text with `--body-file`. When `gh auth status` fails, stop and say so.

## Settings

- Repository: `mvdmio/translation-tools-client-kmp`

## Issues

- **Reference**: `#<number>` or the issue's URL. A run's slug is the number plus the title in kebab case, such as `42-teams-notifications`; the leading number finds the Issue a slug names.
- **File**: `gh issue create --title "…" --body-file <file> --label <status>`, adding the category and context labels. GitHub drops labels silently from an account without triage access: read them back, and name any that are missing in your report. The Issue then counts as `needs-triage`.
- **Read**: `gh issue view <n> --json number,title,body,labels,state,assignees,comments`, plus its blockers.
- **Claim**: read the assignees, and the current user from `gh api user --jq .login`. When another user is assigned, stop and name them. When the current user is the only assignee, the Issue is claimed. With no assignee, run `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` and read the assignees again; when another user is now assigned too, run `gh issue edit <n> --remove-assignee @me` and stop; otherwise the Issue is claimed. The claim stands until the issue closes or the user clears it.
- **List by status**: `gh issue list --state open --label <status> --json number,title,labels`. `needs-triage` is every open issue that carries no status label.
- **Rewrite the body**: `gh issue edit <n> --body-file <file>`.
- **Set status**: `gh issue edit <n> --remove-label <old> --add-label <new>`. An issue carries one status label at a time.
- **Set category**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-label <category>`, removing the other category label.
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <n> --body-file <file>`.
- **Link as blocked by**: `gh api --method POST repos/mvdmio/translation-tools-client-kmp/issues/<n>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<id>`, where `<id>` is the blocker's database id from `gh api repos/mvdmio/translation-tools-client-kmp/issues/<blocker> --jq .id`, not its number. Read them with `gh api repos/mvdmio/translation-tools-client-kmp/issues/<n>/dependencies/blocked_by`. Where dependencies are unavailable, put `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` at the top of the body. A blocker is open while its issue is open.
- **Close as done**: `gh issue close <n> --reason completed --comment "…"`.
- **Close as not planned**: `gh issue close <n> --reason "not planned" --comment "…"`.
- **Closing reference**: a `Closes #<n>` line in the landing commit's message. GitHub closes the issue when that commit reaches the default branch. A blocker has landed on a branch when `git log <branch> --grep "Closes #<n>"` finds a commit.

## Statuses

Each status is a label of the same name: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `needs-grilling`, `needs-human`, `wayfinding`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`. The category is the `bug` or `enhancement` label. In a repo with a `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, the context is a label named and picked as the plugin's `skills/domain-modeling/CONTEXT-PATHS.md` names and picks a context subfolder, `common` included.

## Maps and Decision tickets

A Map is an Issue labelled `wayfinding`. Its Decision tickets are its sub-issues.

- **File a ticket**: file an issue labelled `wayfinder:<type>` — `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task` — then attach it with `gh api --method POST repos/mvdmio/translation-tools-client-kmp/issues/<map>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<id>`, using the ticket's database id. Where sub-issues are unavailable, put `Part of #<map>` at the top of its body and add it to a task list in the Map's body.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, before any other work. A ticket with no assignee is unclaimed.
- **Blocked by**: as for Issues.
- **List the tickets**: `gh api repos/mvdmio/translation-tools-client-kmp/issues/<map>/sub_issues`, with each ticket's state, assignee, and blockers.
- **List the frontier**: the tickets that are open, with no assignee and no open blocker, in the Map's order.
- **Resolve**: comment the answer under `## Answer`, close the ticket as done, and add a line linking it to the Map's Decisions so far.
- **Rule out of scope**: close the ticket as not planned, with a comment saying why.
